# Highlights:
- Added a supervised MicroCT (MCT) segmentation module with real-time preview capabilities (PL-2843)
- Introduced the CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) tool for image processing (MUSA-122)
- Enhanced the Image Log Export Widget to support exporting proportions labelmap with segmentation (MUSA-130)
- Improved ROI visibility and usability by simplifying the UI and refining range sliders for Image Log cropping (MUSA-125)

# New features:
- Added a supervised MicroCT (MCT) segmentation module with real-time preview capabilities (PL-2843)
- Added new visualizations for Kabs (PL-2898)
- Added the CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) tool (MUSA-122)
- Added a bug report upload feature to the service desk for closed-source versions (PL-2857)

# Improvements:
- Enhanced the Image Log Export Widget to support exporting proportions labelmap with segmentation and improved identification of proportions labelmaps (MUSA-130)
- Improved the clone action for nodes to preserve properties and reference nodes, including role references for tables (PL-2914)
- Failed remote jobs can now be restarted when attempting to collect results, with retries occurring in the same directory (PL-2864)
- Adjusted shape factor calculation (PL-2910)
- Reset masking section when effects change (PL-2913)
- Implemented a new parameters architecture for local simulations and enabled parameter node creation after collecting remote execution results. Parameters are now saved after simulation, and the load button in subscale parameters was reintroduced (PL-2904)
- Added the option to load NetCDF files in the data source panel (PL-2901)
- Improved handling of failed extractor jobs and partially failed simulation jobs. Enhanced method and prefix display for Pore Network Model (PNM) remote jobs (PL-2892)
- Centered the modal progress bar (PL-2857)
- Updated the node custom behavior feature (PL-2850)
- Renamed the 'Volumes Crop' module to 'Crop' (PL-2868)
- Improved ROI visibility and usability by simplifying the UI with `ctkRangeSlider` for Image Log cropping (MUSA-125)
- Improved modeling by adding new labels, handling numbers greater than int32_max, and increasing processing speed
- Adjusted segmentation visualization to show segment colors directly

# Bug fixes:
- Fixed an issue with member access during module panel updates (PL-2920)
- Fixed bugs related to Kabs, Krel, and MICP calculations (PL-2918)
- Fixed missing parameter, log step, two-phase cancel, and number of simulations bugs in the simulation workflow (PL-2904)
- Fixed an issue with importing LabelMapVolume from CSV files (MUSA-134)
- Fixed issues with `keep_temporary` and `timeout_enabled` checkboxes, and corrected snapshot selection visibility and behavior (PL-2895)
- Fixed an error during DLIS export caused by a variable with an incorrect name (MUSA-133)
- Addressed several bugs found during integration tests (PL-2850)
- Addressed issues related to memory leaks, stability, and errors during scene closing or segmentation restarts (PL-2843)
- Fixed buggy behavior in spinboxes and UI glitches related to range slider and ROI interaction (MUSA-125)

# Removed:
- Removed the 'Color smudge' option (PL-2913)
- Removed Tesseract from the repository for open-source versions (PL-2868)
- Removed the "Grow from seeds" option from the Thin Section environment (PL-1972)
- Removed deprecated functionalities from the saturation module
